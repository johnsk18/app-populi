### A Customizable Political Campaign App

Please refer to the wiki for set up and customization instructions


## Description
The success of a democracy relies on civic engagement; citizens engaging in ways that span from simply voting in an election to running for elected office. Yet, as campaigning becomes more complicated in the digital age, candidates find themselves in need of increasingly sophisticated outreach tools to compete, which raises the barriers to entry into political races. Our app seeks to reverse this by providing candidates with an open-source mobile app framework, that allows them to create a customized campaign app. Similar to a campaign website, this app would be used by voters, supporters and volunteers to interact with the campaign in a variety of ways, such as learn about events and volunteer opportunities, find polling locations, see the candidateâ€™s positions on various issues, etc.
